I’m always up for a good security chat—whether it’s ideas, feedback, or new opportunities in SOC, Detection Engineering, GRC, or IAM.  
Connect with me on LinkedIn, drop a note via [email](mailto:you@example.com), or browse my [resume](#).  

Happy to help, collaborate, or brainstorm. I usually reply within a day.
