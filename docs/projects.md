This application, designed to let users interact with Maisie the cat, send fan messages, and explore related content, provided an ideal environment to simulate **real-world attack scenarios**.  

The assessment was conducted using **Burp Suite** and **cURL**, with a strict **manual-only approach** (no automated vulnerability scanners) to ensure accuracy and hands-on analysis. The testing process was guided by the **OWASP Top 10** framework, and each vulnerability discovered was carefully evaluated and classified according to the **CVSS v3.1 severity scoring system**, ensuring industry-standard reporting of risk levels.

These projects combined technical depth with governance frameworks, delivering solutions that resonate with both technical and business stakeholders.  

**GDPR & Data Governance (Post-Brexit):** Assessed non-compliance risks and proposed frameworks using **ISO 27001** and **COBIT**, emphasizing robust data retention policies to prevent regulatory penalties.
**Phishing & Identity Security:** Explored phishing detection strategies through the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, with a strong focus on **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** and its impact on reducing account compromise.
**Insider Threat Mitigation:** Investigated high-profile cases (e.g., Tesla, Capital One) and built actionable models leveraging **RBAC, monitoring, and auditing** to minimize misuse of privileged access.  
**CRM & Global Data Breaches:** Identified risks from poor encryption, misconfigured APIs, and weak streaming app integrations, recommending **secure API configurations, end-to-end encryption, and GDPR-aligned controls**.
