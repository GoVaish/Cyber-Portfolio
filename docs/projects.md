**1. Manual Pentesting Assessment**

<img width="300" height="100" alt="Vulnerability Chart" align="right" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31d23919-8840-44c8-8a5b-5d75a310512d" /> As part of my **MSc Cybersecurity portfolio at Roehampton University**, I carried out a **manual penetration test** on the *“Maisie: The Cat”* PHP/MySQL web application.  
This application, designed to let users interact with Maisie the cat, send fan messages, and explore related content, provided an ideal environment to simulate **real-world attack scenarios**.  

The assessment was conducted using **Burp Suite** and **cURL**, with a strict **manual-only approach** (no automated vulnerability scanners) to ensure accuracy and hands-on analysis. The testing process was guided by the **OWASP Top 10** framework, and each vulnerability discovered was carefully evaluated and classified according to the **CVSS v3.1 severity scoring system**, ensuring industry-standard reporting of risk levels.
